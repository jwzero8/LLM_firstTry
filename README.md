# LLM_firstTry
First Try on LLM, output looks weird but showed improvement after finetuning the cross-entropy loss

Note: I don't write this thing solely on my own but with tons of aids from GenAI and this is sort of coursework learning

• Implemented basic LLM architecture using PyTorch, including transformer models and tokenization
• Developed data preprocessing pipelines and training workflows
• Utilized wandb for experiment tracking and model performance optimization
